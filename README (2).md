# Persian-English-Translator

This is a simple bilingual dictionary application built using Python and Tkinter. The application allows the user to input a Persian (Farsi) word and returns its English translation if it exists in the predefined dictionary.

## Features

- Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Tkinter  
- Persian to English word translation  
- Error handling for unknown words  
- Easy to extend with more vocabulary  

## How It Works

1. The user enters a Persian word in the input field.
2. On clicking the "Translate" button, the program checks the dictionary.
3. If the word is found, its English equivalent is shown.
4. If the word is not found, a message is displayed saying the word was not found.

## Example Words in Dictionary

| Persian (Farsi) | English     |
|-----------------|-------------|
| سلام            | hello       |
| کتاب            | book        |
| سیب             | apple       |
| مدرسه           | school      |
| دوست           | friend      |

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## How to Run

1. Save the script as translator_gui.py (or any name you like).
2. Run the script using Python:

```

> Note: Make sure the file name is correct when running the script.
